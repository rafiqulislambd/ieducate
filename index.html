				Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
				knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate
				societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.
				Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation
				to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills
				that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed.
				Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[2]

				Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
				knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods
				include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research.
				Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however
				learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or
				informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way
				one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of
				teaching is called pedagogy.

				Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten,
				primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

				A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a]
				In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform,
				and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the
				Sustainable Development Goal 4,
				which promotes quality education for all.

				Programs at ISCED level 2, lower secondary education are usually organized
				around a more subject-oriented curriculum; differing from primary education.
				Teachers typically have pedagogical training in the specific subjects and,
				more often than at ISCED level 1, a class of students will have several teachers,
				each with specialized knowledge of the subjects they teach. Programmes at ISCED level 2,
				aim to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon introducing
				theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects which can be developed in future stages.
				Some education systems may offer vocational education programs
				during ISCED level 2 providing skills relevant to employment.
